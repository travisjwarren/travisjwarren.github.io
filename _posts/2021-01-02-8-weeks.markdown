This is the question on my mind right now with good reason. I’m fortunate enough to be able to combine annual and long service leave kicking off at Christmas. Good times.

A few things immediately spring to mind, enjoying Christmas with the family first and foremost. Ignoring the clock will be nice with ample time to chill with the wife and kids.

On the sport front, it’s USA all the way with NFL & NBA. The amount of basketball on fits nice as I keep working on the react / amplify Dribble Drive application. 

The EPL interest is slightly diminished with Arsenal’s recent struggles. But 3 wins over Boxing Day to New Years stretch has pricked the interest once again.

Australian summer....May have to squeeze in the odd bit of test cricket. That’s a given.

Outside of the personal stuff I’m thinking about getting back to writing through my blog. Hence this post.

Will pop a few posts up the next couple of months around some learnings and the path ahead in 2021.
