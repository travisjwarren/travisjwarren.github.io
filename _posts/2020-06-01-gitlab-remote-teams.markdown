Recently I completed the managing remote teams course run by GitLab on Coursera.  With the impacts of COVID on the move to remote work I thought it would be timely to invest time into this subject.

A key learning from the course was the concepts of synchronous and asynchronous workflows. The more distributed a team is the larger impediment to delivery synchronous workflows become to task completion.  

In the language of agile, they are hand offs.  Every time a resource depends on another resource  it causes waste.  

The key to removing this waste to getting knowledge out of your teams collective heads is a strong focus on documentation.  

As a leader of distributed technology teams across regions and timezones this was an ‘ah-ha’ moment.  

A lack attention to documentation and actual documentation itself has long been a systemic issue.  There is a long term price to pay for the easier option of ‘keeping it in your head’.  When remote teams can’t access this information when required work stops.  

Investment in strong documentation is integral to remote teams being able to scale quickly.
