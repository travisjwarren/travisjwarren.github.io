I'm three games into the AIC season and I think the data collection UX is just about right!

In game experience is very smooth with shooting percentages, category comparisons and score graphs all now functional.

Some link sharing has been well received for live tracking by some users not at games.  The amplify subscriptions are still a bit of a mystery so I'm yet to heavily share this feature.

The game season and round views have got me thinking about possibility of some power ranking functionality.  May fit into the thought bubble around 'socal sport' I originally had.
