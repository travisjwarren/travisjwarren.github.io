Three games into the AIC season and 'Ingest / Collect' UX is just about right! Using Amplify for AppSync to DynamoDB has definately ticked off the 'Store' phase of the solution.

In game experience of visualization feels smooth with shooting percentages, category comparisons and score graphs all now functional.

Some link sharing has been well received for live tracking by some users not at games.  The amplify subscriptions are still a bit of a mystery so I'm yet to heavily share this feature.

Now the datasets have evolved it will be time to invest in Analytics to process / analyze data to build out more in depth visualisations.

The game season and round views have got me thinking about possibility of some power ranking functionality.  May fit into the thought bubble around 'socal sport' I originally had.
