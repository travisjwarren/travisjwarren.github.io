Over the past few weeks I’ve been going back to school on UX design. 

Learning about react in Dribble Drive, I’ve been using material-ui for the front end. It has a vast collection of UI components as building blocks.  Importantly it’s very well documented with a large collection of examples.

Over the past few weeks while digging deeper in the abundant documentation (thanks google) I stumbled into motion concepts.

`The motion system is a set of transition patterns that can help users understand and navigate an app.`

Being an old web type person, I’ve been more inclined to think pages. Moving toward ‘single page site’ requires a change in mind set when moving users through a site. 

`Motion helps orient users by showing how elements in a transition are related.`

Motion and transition become the glue that binds your site together. 

A study of both concepts will pay off for you and your site especially in relation to mobile first experiences.
