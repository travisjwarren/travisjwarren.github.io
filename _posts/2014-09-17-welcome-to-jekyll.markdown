Time has come to bite the bullet!  Shipping is the current vibe.

A live scoring feature in the form of scoring drills (1 / 2/ 3 hits and misses) has surfaced after a period of significant refactoring and learning.

Overriding feeling is...it's time.

I will give it a test drive at Villa training tomorrow night to see what type of data set I get pull out of it.

For those looking for a play, heres a link that should give you an idea of where we are going.  [Shooting Drill](https://staging.d12zg4vx914t91.amplifyapp.com/shooting)
